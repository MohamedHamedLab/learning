# Jest

### Unit test

The smallest parts of an application are called units, testing of those units to check whether it is fit for use or not is called unit testing.

### Integration Testing

In the context of Unit Testing, testing the interactions between two units called Integration Testing. Scenarios like function under test calling another function with some context. We should still mock the outside resources but need to test those integration links.

### Using Jest + Enzyme

While Jest is a testing framework you can think of Enzyme as a library that makes it easier to select and query elements inside of an emulated DOM.
