Should I Care?

### Mindset Makes the Difference

A software team is having the daily meeting. Like every other day, they're starting at 10:00 in the

morning around the same task board in their office room. They are talking about what they did yesterday,

planning the work for today, and there is always keeping the discussion in time blocks of 15 minutes. This

team is basically conducting the meeting as described in one of the most popular Agile frameworks.

Some of you may recognize this as the Daily Scrum. Now, let's meet a team member, Jerry. Jerry has

already given his update, but a few minutes before the end of the meeting, Jerry is in doubt. Maybe he

should mention potential code vulnerability he noticed in the checked out code earlier this morning. But

then he's thinking, the Daily Scrum is about to end, and he would need to ask his colleagues to meet

again for another discussion and maybe even postpone the regular daily release procedure. And in the

end, without further analysis, he's not completely sure of the vulnerability. Let's imagine Jerry decides to

keep his thoughts to himself, and the cold gets released. And unfortunately, the security breach really

happens, bringing significant financial or reputational damage to the company. Or imagine Jerry saved

the day instead by simply deciding to interact openly with his teammates rather than focusing too much

on daily procedures. In our story, Daily Scrum meeting took place with its built‑in opportunity for

discussion, but it's Jerry's way of thinking that brings two completely different scenarios. The mindset of

one person sometimes has a big impact on our organization, not to mention how huge this becomes on a

scale of tens, hundreds, or thousands of employees. Many teams in the organizations decide to take an

Agile journey. They sign up to an Agile framework, adopt its processes and practices, and maybe see

some improvements. But only some succeed in bringing the real benefits of Agile working ways. And the

main reason is that, besides having all formal elements in place, only some work on the less tangible, but

the extremely important and foundational element of any true Agile organization, the Agile mindset.

### Doing vs. Being Agile

Throughout my career, I've been working with many agile teams in different organizations, and I've

always been intrigued by the repeating pattern where mindset plays such an important element in

success. Maybe because developing the agile mindset is more challenging, a less tangible part of the

equation, and it's never algorithmic like. You can imagine success with agile as something that is based

on both visible and invisible elements. Visible is easier, right? You introduce the process, experiment with

best practices, improve on the goal, and if you do your homework well, you will see some results. For

example, you start to use the task board, burndown or velocity chart, and you instantly improve visibility.

You introduce testing earlier in the process, and you will improve quality sooner. On the other side, the

invisible part, the mindset, requires more time and skills, especially if your organization is far from where

it wants to be. But the level of benefits is also incomparably higher. The agile mindset brings real value,

the essence, things like engaged and reliable teams and delighted customers. People often think of

visible versus invisible as doing versus being agile. And we undoubtedly need a holistic approach. We

surely need excellent practitioners to do agile, but even more, we need to continuously work on being

agile. And it sounds like a lot to do, which I'll be honest, is. So whether you're starting, extending or

improving your agile journey, it's good to make sure you truly want and need the benefits of agile in the

first place, but also that you're ready to accept some trade‑offs. And this applies to everyone in the

organization, starting from leaders. For example, if you want to change a more traditionally oriented

organizational mindset to agile, you need to shift the primary focus from the efficiency of the process to

people in your teams, or from fixed‑scope plans to adoption of change. But deciding to become agile

may be the best decision you can make for your company if you want to put primary focus on customer

satisfaction, engaged and happy teams who continuously grow and deliver, adaptiveness, or even to

foster innovation and creativity. Okay, by now we've talked about why we should care about developing

the agile mindset, but what agile mindset is exactly? It has become a buzzword among leaders in various

organizations, but it's often misinterpreted or misused. So in the following modules we will first demystify

the words, and then we'll talk about how to embrace the agile mindset in organizational environments.

### Understanding the Agile Mindset

### Human Mindset

The human mindset is the most powerful tool in the world. It's the key driver of business success or

failure, but also the one that makes a crucial difference for us personally. Our mindset is the main reason

why we think, act, or perform differently. And yet, the alignment of individual mindset with the corporate

culture and corporate success often doesn't get enough attention. And how can we improve that? How

can we understand our minds better and use that knowledge to empower our organizations? To answer

these questions, let's see how the mindset is created and what it consists of. Over the years, experts have

been arguing about what makes the most influence on human mindsetting; our genes, let's call it nature,

or everything that has been around us in our lifetime, the environment. Nature and environment shape

the mindset, but in which ways? What does mindset consist of? In the context of this course, we're going

to talk about its two main elements, values and principles. Values are the foundation. It's basically what

we believe is important in our life or work. Values help to form principles. The principles are built‑in rules

that guide our actions and decisions. Now, values and principles are what's under the surface, but they

become tangible and visible to the outside world when manifested in our behaviors. Let's make this

concrete through our earlier example with Jerry. And now we're talking about Jerry who brings the

happy ending, the one who prevents security breach. He obviously believes openness is important in

work. This is one of his core values, and it has helped him to form his working principle, which is always

proactively share important information with teammates. These two manifested in Jerry's behavior when

he expressed his concerns about code vulnerability and prevented security breach. These are individual

values, principles, and behaviors, but where things become interesting is when it comes to the alignment

with the working surrounding. And it goes both ways. An individual can influence the environment, but

also the environment highly influences the individual mindset. And this is good news because it means

that strategic development of organizational values and principles can encourage desirable behaviors of

people who matter the most, who make the difference between success and failure; our employees. In

the next clip, we'll be focusing specifically on agile values and principles.

### Agile Values

For the start, let's clear up two common misconceptions. First, some people believe agile values and

principles are prescriptive, but it's actually the opposite. In its essence, being agile is exactly about

removing constraints, about the ability to create and respond to change freely. The reason for this first

misconception is that people often mix the meaning of being agile with a variety of rules, tools, practices,

or even decorations available in the field of doing agile today. The second misconception is that agile

values and principles are theoretical. Again, it's not true, as they emerge from the practice itself. They

were created in 2001 by a group of software developers who wished to change the ways the software

was developed at that time, and it wasn't working anymore in new, changing, and complex environments.

They got together, pulled information from the practice, discussed their common experiences, things that

did or didn't work well. And then as a result, they created the statement with 4 agile values and 12

principles rooted deeply in the real life world. This statement was called the Agile Manifesto, and it turned

out to be so useful around the globe that it basically changed the industry, and its usage was extended

far beyond the software development. So the authors of the manifesto state, we are uncovering better

ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to

value: individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive

documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, responding to change over following a

plan. As you can see, the agile values are far from prescriptive. They don't say you must do this or that.

The manifesto never said you shouldn't have processes and tools; it just values more individuals and

interactions. The same applies to working software, customer collaboration, or responding to change.

Namely, it's clearly stated, while there is value on the items on the right, we value the items on the left

more. The organizations with developed agile mindsets simply recognize these alternatives in real life

situations, and they focus their energy on more valuable choices.

### Agile Principles

In addition to agile values, there are 12 principles behind the agile manifesto. Now we won't analyze each

principal separately, but they believe it's extremely important you become aware of them. So let's cover

them quickly, and I'll leave you to interpret their meaning in your particular business context. Ready to

take the challenge? Okay, here we go. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and

continuous delivery of valuable software. Welcome changing requirements even late in development.

Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. Deliver working software

frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with the preference to the shorter timescale.

Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. Build projects around

motivated individuals, give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job

done. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development

team is face‑to‑face conversation. Working software is the primary measure of progress. Agile processes

promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a

constant pace indefinitely. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential. The best architectures,

requirements, and designs emerge from self‑organizing teams. At regular intervals, the team reflects on

how to become more effective, then chooses and adjust its behavior accordingly. For more information,

please visit agilemanifesto.org. I hope at this point in time, you have a good idea about what an agile

mindset is. And now we're ready to talk about how to embrace this mindset in your organization.

### Embracing the Mindset

### Expectations

Okay, by now we've talked about what the agile mindset is and why it's important, and now we'll be

focusing on how to embrace it. But before we dive into the subject, I'd firstly like to manage your

expectations of what this means. We're typically used to understanding a plan as something that clearly

defines goals or objectives, the course affection, and the specific time frame, but agile mindset adoption

doesn't have one final destination and delivery date, nor the algorithm that brings us there. One of the

main reasons is that the mindset is subject to continuous improvement, or in other words, if you become

agile, you can never be agile enough. There are many parallel examples in life and work, but let's take

one, professional growth. When somebody is starting their professional career, of course, they can't say

in 5 years, I planned to gain all the knowledge there is about the work, then I will be so professional that I

can stay competitive for the rest of my career, or at least it wouldn't be good for anybody to think that

way. The same applies to the agile mindset growth. There is no defined endpoint when a company can

say that mindset is shaped, and neglect the continuously‑changing world. So in this module, we'll not be

revealing magic recipes for definite success, but we'll be covering some guidelines that can help you

succeed with your own unique approach towards agility. At this point in time, it's also important to

understand that you should avoid creating selective plans, or in other words, it's important to develop all

agile values in parallel. For example, you can focus completely on valuing working software, but it doesn't

mean much if you're following outdated plans, or the other way around, you can respond to a change,

but this won't be good enough if the delivery is slowed down by the unnecessary comprehensive

documentation work. So to become agile, companies often need to plan a significant change, cultural

change, which is usually challenging, but also extremely rewarding. And everyone needs to get ready,

including you.

### Getting Ready

You already know your organizational culture. It's probably intentionally shaped in a certain way, or

maybe it happens spontaneously, but in any case, there are already some common values, principles, and

behaviors in your company that affect each aspect of your business, from employees, to customers, to

public image. So the first thing to be done when working on the agile mindset is certainly to evaluate

how close or distant your current culture is from agile values and principles. This is already an indication

of whether you'll need months or years to embrace the mindset and how complex your journey will be.

But anyhow, the change is inevitable, together with accompanying challenges. People will need to get

out of their comfort zone, change their working ways, and maybe even reassess their inner values. And to

make it possible, you'll need to ensure they're operating in a psychologically‑safe environment, which

means they feel secure to discuss problems, admit mistakes, share new ideas, or ask for help. To make

this more concrete, let's imagine your company is about to start a software project for an important

customer. The project leader discovers a mistake in the already‑communicated project plan. This might

not be the best news, but you can react in different ways, for example, charge the project leader, who

could consequently hide problems next time, or welcome the opportunity to adapt to the new situation

early. Build trust by discussing things openly, and help everyone learn from this mistake. In high

performing psychologically‑safe environments, people are kept accountable for the results, but also the

failure is considered to be a completely normal part of the learning process. However, even with

established psychological safety, not every moment is the best one for mindset adoption. To get off to a

good start, choose a moment that promises success without high risks, in other words, the moment that

will provide enough capacity and focus for such a substantial change and will help to build a positive

atmosphere around it. And then you can start to work on awareness. Let's talk about that.

### Awareness and Motivation

One of my favorite books is Don Quixote, a wonderful story about a gentleman who decides to become a

knight‑errant to revive chivalry. His intention is strong. He puts on shiny armor, mounts his horse, and

leaves his village in search of adventures. But there is one big obstacle to his mission, everybody else

sees things differently. For instance, he's fighting the demons, but everyone thinks they're nothing more

than windmills. People in his village tried to convince him of his lunacy, they're even burning his books,

the main source of his ideas, and so on, and so forth. If you haven't already, I recommend you read Don

Quixote, but of course I'm not here to talk about novels, and I won't interpret the ending. I just think this

story reflect what is very important in our context. The mission of a person is very difficult in the world

where everyone else sees things differently, or getting back to our course, what they want to say is that

the key to a good start of agile mindset development is people's awareness and motivation. If we want to

have a change, everyone needs to know where we're heading and why this is good for them and for the

company. I will leave it up to you to think about the best communication ways to raise awareness in your

specific organizational context. Maybe you will think of meetings, training, coaching, or something

completely different, but what I would like to point out is that this shouldn't be something reserved for

technology teams only, everyone needs to be on board, complete organization, including leadership and

customers. A common mistake is to leave customers out of these initial discussions with wrong

expectations. This can impose huge limitations on future organizational mindset growth. Actually, it's not

even possible to be agile without being on the same page with customers about this. Motivation is also

something that requires a careful approach. Again, we'll not be diving into an explanation of motivational

tools, which is another topic, but what I'm trying to say is that people need strong reasons to change

their values, behaviors, habits. Everyone should have a clear picture of what the promise of the new

organizational mindset is in a general context, but also personally, in the context of their own position or

role. And this is something where you, as a leader, can make a huge difference. Demonstrate your own

enthusiasm and commitment, but also find a way specific to your organization to raise employee's

awareness and get general buy in.

### Continuity

Awareness and motivation are a good start, but their continuity is a necessity. Only continuity ensures

that an agile mindset eventually becomes an integral part of the organization. To achieve this, old and

new behaviors that reflect agile values and principles need to be continuously and transparently

recognized, encouraged, and brought into the mainstream. To explain this, let's imagine a software

developer sharing an excellent idea of integrating a newly released game‑changing alternative to already

used software libraries. An agile leader would recognize this person is responding to change, rather than

just following the plan, welcome to proposed idea, and share the example with others. In this way, people

would get encouraged to react to technology changes more and bring their ideas to the table. But of

course, one leader can't know the details of everyone's day‑to‑day work. Individuals and teams who

manifest agile behaviors can help with this. Change leaders need to be appointed primarily based on

their motivation, influence, the ability to identify, own, and act upon the problems, rather than their

position in the organizational structure. As a matter of fact, role models within different organizational

groups can have a strong positive influence on collective behaviors. Okay, now let's touch upon some

tools which can further help with the continuity.

### Being and Doing

At the beginning of this course, we mentioned that being agile is different from just doing agile. We've

also indicated their interdependency, but now we're going to talk more about that. When a company

actively works on being agile by nurturing awareness and motivation, it's actually necessary to also do

agile. If wisely implemented, agile processes and practices can even foster the mindset growth. And by

now we've been discussing the kind of journey where an organization first gets ready, works on overall

awareness and motivation, and then rolls out the mindset adoption with accompanying process changes.

But this is not the only way organizations choose to take. Some encounter a situation where they need to

reverse the journey and start with the processes rollout. Typically, they change the development

processes first, and then through doing, they build in some agile mindset elements. Even though it's

possible to make improvements this way, the reverse approach brings its inevitable risks and limitations.

For example, by not understanding the big picture, teams may fall into a trap where they execute the

process in a semi‑robotic fashion. Only by doing, they can bring some short‑term improvements, but they

can also easily feel resistant, miss the main purpose and, not surprisingly, fail to deliver long‑term value.

So how can we make sure to align doing agile with being agile in day‑to‑day work? Simply by

empowering people to ask why. Everyone should understand the purpose of their actions. Remember

Jerry? Do you think he knew the real purpose of the daily scrum. In the scrum framework, this meeting

shouldn't be a status update, but an opportunity for teammates to openly discuss daily progress and

impediments. If Jerry had felt this, I believe he would have decided to share his concerns easily. I hope

you enjoyed the course. Thanks for watching and see you next time. We hope you enjoyed this course. If
