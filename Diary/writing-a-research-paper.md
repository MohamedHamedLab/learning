# Writing a Research Paper

## Understanding the topic

## how to narrow down a research topic

### Do general research

To help you decide on the idea to develop

Focused research to narrow the focus and give deeper understanding of the topic

The path to organize a research

1. Know your topic
2. Find the research
3. Review the research

You may need to add or remove from your research

Depend on how much new information have found

**Ways to start writing**

### Focused freewriting

The method of writing for those how want ideas to flow quickly without the temptation to stop and analyze each point before including it.

Set timer 15 minutes during this time you fore your self to keep those words flowing. Never stop writing, even if you repeat the same idea two or three times, and never worry about mechanics just write.

After the free writing read what you've writing and underline or highlight what seems like important or key ideas that your research has revealed then categories that will lead to final outline .

### Barnstorming

This is a early attempts to determine what key point you want to consider including in the research paper.

Method: listing any and all the ideas that you know or came in your mind, main ideas will be mixed with examples and details.

The disadvantage of this method is the ideas are random order each will have to be evaluated as you continue organizing your research

### Clustering ideas (spider web/map)

The advantage of that method is that is will allow you to see how the ideas connect and put the sub points on you mind as you progress, and you will spend more time to deiced where each bubble should be placed. Example

1. Bit the disadvantages are that sometimes for long research paper bubbles will get hard to follow
2. Dropping and grouping

The result of this you will be able to create outline , you can use one or more to get your result.

Organize and arrange the information in the final paper to make it easy to follow , clear and makes sense.

- **Developing thesis statement :**

to be the main idea or the controlling idea , this idea should be as specific as possible to give you a clear idea what will be included in the paper, to give your reader a clear idea of what expect in the paper , some time the these statement will be at the beginning of the research, it doesn’t matter if you prepare the thesis statement before or after the research, it must be prepared before the actual writing is started, it Cleary identifies the key ideas for your paper

- **topic sentences :**

the main idea supporting paragraph , so the thesis will followed in the research paper the topic sentence tell you will followed in the paragraph

The first sentence of the paragraph should not be too broad or too narrow.

Paragraph: is one idea developed to support that one idea and that one idea stated in the pyrograph's topic , each paragraph has 120 to 150 word.

Supporting depth: for each main idea you need the support to include to fully explain each topic sentence and ultimately the thesis , using example, case study, facts , statistics , experiment results

- **Transitions** is the glut that hold the parts together, reading something that jumps from a point to a point is difficult. Reader need connector that glue to show how the various topics support the ideas are tied together in a logic pattern

There is four transitional methods are possible

The first is to repeat the key word or words, When the reader repeatedly sees a word or idea he is guided smoothly from point to point

The second is to use synonym for the key words, this can be used if using the same word will sound too redundant

Third technique is to use pronoun references such as (this, he, who)

Fourth technique use transitional words (or, in additional , even though, and , rather than) Transitional words must be chosen carefully because different transitional words show different relationships.

- **Introduction:** "the thesis statement & get the reader attention"

Sometimes writing the body first will help you compose the introduction, whether it's written first or last the introduction has specific requirements ,

First it will contain the thesis statement, the sentence that will tell the reader the purpose of the topic because its important for the reader to know the central idea.

The first

You should to avoid sentences like "I'm going to show you that" or "I'm going to discuss this topic" the topic and the research should focus on the research rather than the writer

Ideas for introduction is to use

illustration example

using quote from someone famous

give a surprising fact

General or narrow example "Much attention being given today to high school graduation rates"

- **Body:**

The only time you should start writing the body is after the brainstorming and outlining all of your ideas and the thesis for the entire paper now you can start writing the first draft.

**Each topic body will contain**

Topic sentence

Support

Major ideas

Minor ideas

Documentation

Transition

- **Ending "Summary "**

The summary should contain thelogical completion of the main points in the paper to leave the reader with a final thought the ending like the intoduction can take different forms depending on the topic, even though you do have choices for ending

"as I told you in the beginning .."

"I'm now going to end my paper"

"in conclusion" not correct ways to end your topic

The point here to end with the final point , don't just summarize leave the reader with something rememberable you will need to leave the reader with something to think about.

Like end with a thought provoking question

Or end with a call to action

Or end with why this topic is important

Or end with real life example

Or end with a general to narrow ideas.

So the purpose of the ending is to give a clear memorable idea

- The title

The title maybe the last thing you compose but it’s the first thing the reader sees, so you want the first impression to be passive

You want to avoid any title is too broad

To help you compose the title go back and look at your thesis statement, introduction and conclusion , even think about your audience a good title has two purposes first, it gives or indirectly suggest the subject of the topic the second to make the reader interest in your topic, maybe you can give the thought provoking question.
