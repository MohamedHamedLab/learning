# Storytelling for Business Video

When I say story, I'm talking about a series of events, and these events must have four essential components.

- First, these events must be connected. Generally this means the same main characters appear in each event, but it doesn't have to mean that. The events can be connected by a similar activity, or a similar location, or connected by the same theme.
- Your series of events must also contain characters.
- your story must have tension. There must be a feeling of stress, of something unresolved. Generally, this stress will be felt by your main character
- The last component is conflict. Today we still find stories most entertaining when they show us how to solve a problem. And that means we must introduce conflict, the pitting of two opposite forces against one another.

  writers and artists have codified a set of fundamental story conflicts.

1. Person versus nature. Some writers have said that this isn't a genuine concept, since nature has no free will. Those writers might want to express this as person versus God, or person versus fate.
2. Person versus self. The is the internal struggle. I love him, but I hate him. I consider myself honest, but that money is just sitting there for the taking. I really wanna lose weight for my reunion, but I really love chocolate cake and I work in a bakery. Now, that's conflict
3. Person versus society. This is when the main character's desires, needs, values, or what have you, directly conflict with those of her society at large. A rebel, or revolutionary, perfectly exemplifies a character who will struggle with this conflict.
4.  Person versus person. I've saved this one for last, because it's the most common.

## The three-act structure

The first act will introduce your viewer to your main character's everyday world. It probably feels pretty normal, although on closer inspection it's apparent that there's something missing. Our main character isn't as happy, or as safe, or as something as she could be.

The second act usually shows your main character trying to solve her problem and failing. That's because she doesn't have the magic ingredient that only you can give her. Which you do, of course, in act three. And they all live happily ever after.

## Infotainment

Your business video must truthfully inform and entertain. That's called infotainment. Why is infotainment so important to your business video? Half the answer, you already know. The most engaging way to communicate your message is via storytelling. Your viewer won't just be happier that your video is engaging, he'll be more likely to absorb your message.

### Tell the truth

Make a list of words that you hope would ideally describe the product, service, or whatever message you're trying to get across. I'll continue my self-examination by using this course.

1. I hope you find this course informative. That's it's mission after all, to teach. 
2. I'd like it to be entertaining, so that you're not bored, and can absorb the information more readily. 
3. I hope the information is valid and dependable. There's no point in teaching you stuff that doesn't work reliably or isn't true.
4. I also wish this course to be clear. This isn't advanced calculus. You should get it on the first or second try. 
5. It's important to me that the course be an excellent value, more than worth the money you've paid for it.
6. I hope that you feel the course is trustworthy. If you trust this course, you're more likely to trust me, and come back to me for more courses.

 What's the list of descriptors for your message? Does it start to describe an attractive and distinctive personality?

## Creating Your Hero

### Main character

The main character is your entryway into your story, and usually, the bringer of your important message. And here are a few things about your main character that you may not expect to be true.

First, your main character needn't be a person. 

If you were creating a romance, it would make sense to make your main character a man or a woman. 

In a cop show, you probably want your main character to be a police officer, 

but this is a business video, sure there's a good chance you'll wind up with a main character who's a human being, but don't start there, be imaginative. Maybe your main character ought to be your **product itself.** 

Think about a TV commercial for automobile tires, who's the main character? The sharp-dresser behind the wheel, the shiny car he's driving, or that high-tech rubber doughnut that gets both man and machine home safely, through treacherous snow and slippery rain? That tire is your hero.

### Brand persona (your brand must reflect your personal values)

your brand persona is that set of relatable human traits and attributes that represent your brand. Let's put it this way.

If your company magically turned into a person, he or she would be your brand persona. Sometimes that magic actually happens, but in reverse. Take Apple, the folks who make the phones. What qualities and traits come to mind about the company? How about smart, intuitive, striking, magical, powerful, dependable? How about authoritative, geeky? Certainly not cheap. If you read about Apple, you know that the company can be all these things.

### It lives!

Building your character in two basic sections, mind and heart. First, the brain, the seed of thought and logic. How does your main character make decisions? Does she collect as much data as possible?

### Value proposition

The value proposition tells your audience why they should do what you're telling them to. In the world of advertising and marketing that why usually has to do with how your product or service will solve a pressing problem and do it better than any other way

<aside>
📝 Uber. "Uber is the smartest way to get around. "One tap and a car comes directly to you. "Your driver knows exactly where to go. "And payment is completely cashless."

</aside>

### Plot line

The purpose of your plot line is to use your characters to carry your message or moral to your audience. Unlike many movie and TV shows, and almost all novels and short stories, your message shouldn't be buried in your business video. You need your plot line to convey your message front and center to your audience. Think of your plot line as a river that floats a boat filled with your message right up to the shore where your audience awaits.

### Mind mapping

Mind mapping says that every aspect of your project or whatever part of your project that you're currently working on, radiates from a single idea, like the trunk of a tree. Related ideas shoot off that trunk like primary branches.

Subsequent ideas and details gather around specific branches like smaller branches and finally, leaves. Once you have your idea tree, you can draw connections between ideas and different groups, move ideas around, add and eliminate, even plop down new basic concepts that will become their own idea trees

### Back to the beginning

Let's look at the basic structure or story beats of your three essential acts. Act one is two story beats in one. First we introduce your viewer to the normal world. This is not the normal world in which you and I live. This is the normal world that you created for your characters to live in, complete with unbreakable rules.

Next, we show something go wrong. Usually this is something that happens to your main character, something the normal world or a force outside it has perpetrated. But it could be something your main character has perpetrated upon herself or upon others.
