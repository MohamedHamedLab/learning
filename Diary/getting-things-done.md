## Overview of Getting Things Done

Getting Things Done is a set of practices that I have researched and tested over many, many years.

It's really not about time management.

It's really more about how do we manage our focus, how do we manage our attention.

So a quick overview of how it all hangs together is really five steps. These five steps, I didn't really make them up. I just started to understand what really goes on when we get things under control.

<aside>
ðŸ“– Like if you've ever had your kitchen out of control, what did you do to get it back in stable ground so you could focus on cooking dinner?

</aside>

Well, you actually go through five steps, whether it's your kitchen or your company or anything that you want to get under control. Quite simply,

the first step is to **capture and to recognise** anything that's not on cruise control, and you need to identify those things. So you need to capture or collect anything that may be out of place or not exactly where it needs to be.

The second thing to do with it is you **make decisions** about what it is that you captured. Clarify exactly what those things mean to you. In other words, is it something to move on or not? Is it something that belongs where it is? Does it represent something else that I need to keep track of? Once you do that, if you've captured all of those things and you've clarified what they mean, then you want to organize the results of that thinking.

**Organisation** just means I need to park these things where they go so I don't have to keep rethinking them or have them still bother me or somehow distract me from what I'm doing.

Now once you've done all that, then you need to **step back and review and reflect** on what all of this means, sort of the larger gestalt, the larger picture, the larger inventory of what all these things are.

Once you've done that, I've captured the things that had my attention, clarified exactly what they mean, parked them where they go, and step back and see the whole picture,

that's when I can start to **make good, trusted, intuitive choices** about what exactly I do and how do I allocate my resources about all of that.

<aside>
ðŸ“– So to take an example of your kitchen, you walk in, gee, it's out of control. So you start cleaning it up, you start gathering things together, and then you say, well, what exactly are these? Does that belong in the refrigerator? Does that go in the trash? And then you step back and then you maybe pull out your recipe, take a look and make sure you have all the ingredients, and then you start actually making dinner.

</aside>

So it's a common sense kind of thing. It's a common approach to how we do all of that. However, applying that in a much more sophisticated way in the kind of world that we're dealing with, the speed and volume of input that we're all having to manage on an hour by hour basis, applying those principles actually are something that people don't automatically or naturally seem to do.

It's actually something you'll need to learn how to do and you can get much better at.

So Getting Things Done is really the methodology of those best practices put together in such a way so that you can surf on top of your life and your work and not be distracted by it and you're being fully present with what you're doing.

## Capturing things

first main thingÂ that you really have to do to get things under controlÂ and to get focused,

that's this stage called Capture.

Often when we work with people one-on-one,Â the first thing we'll do is look around in their workspaceÂ and say what doesn't belong here.

What's not supplies or reference materialÂ or decoration or equipment?

Those four things, by the way,Â supplies, reference material, decoration, and equipment,Â are the only things that actually belongÂ where they are the way they are.

Everything else represents something in transit,Â in motion, in progress,Â something that probably represents somethingÂ you need to finish, decide about, do, or do something with.

Maybe it's a report sitting on your desk,Â or it's something you still need to read,Â or a memo you need to respond to.

Or maybe it's a flashlight with dead batteries in itÂ that's sitting there you need to do something about.

So all of that stuff should be gathered together.

And we love using in-trays for that.Â Here's an example of my in-tray, which I love.Â I use this more than anybody,Â because I need a place to be able to dump all the stuffÂ from my pockets, from meetings, business cards, receipts,Â anything like that.

So a physical in-tray is a really cool toolÂ and a really useful thing just for yourself to useÂ to be able to gather all that stuff together.

Once we **gather all the physical things**Â that might represent something that's incomplete,Â or as we say, an Open Loop,Â something that still needs to be finishedÂ or something done about it,Â then we say okay, let's get your mind empty.

We do what we call a **Mind Sweep**.Â A Mind Sweep would be simply anything that you haveÂ your attention on at all.

I need to rewrite the strategic plan.Â My Aunt Matilda is coming to visit.Â I need to handle all of that.Â I've got a holiday coming up I need to plan,Â et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, those kinds of things.

So a lot of the Getting Things Done methodologyÂ is about paying attention to what has your attention.

A great way to capture that, of course,Â is to write it down.Â That's the most obvious way to do it.Â You know, I need cat food, or a strategic plan,Â whatever it is, and then capture all of that in some place.Â For most people, by the way, that can takeÂ from one to six hours, just to gather togetherÂ and identify the things that are pulling on their psyche.

So the best practice here in Capture is to make sureÂ that you've grabbed some sort of placeholder for anythingÂ that's got your attention,Â little, big, personal, or professional,Â in some trusted place, some trusted bucket.

And a trusted bucket means I've put it somewhereÂ and I'm not gonna lose it and I will get to it laterÂ before too long, and it's some place that I trust.

<aside>
ðŸš« The worst practice is to make some agreement with yourself,Â some would, could, should, and leave it in your head,Â because that's the leakiest place in the world.Â Your head is a terrible office.Â Your head is for having ideas, not for holding them.

</aside>

So this is a major, major habit change,Â by the way, for most adults.Â That means you need tools.Â The most obvious I mentioned already, just pen and paper.

I carry my most critical tool for ideas I getÂ that are right here in my pocket,Â and just writing stuff down.Â I don't know what's on here, but I will soon enough.Â I also then will take these notes and put themÂ in my own in-tray, so that they're not lost.

Obviously anything that can record an idea,Â you could use your smartphone, leave yourself a message.Â You can write it on a whiteboard.Â Any of that works, as long as you put it somewhereÂ that you know you won't lose it.Â And by the way, the more sophisticatedÂ you get professionally, the more your good ideas about workÂ will not happen at work.

You'll be buying bread at the storeÂ and thinking of something to bring upÂ at the marketing meeting.

You'll be in the marketing meeting rememberingÂ you need bread.Â So I like the idea that your mind is for having ideas,Â and you really need to have that idea just once.

So again, Capture, collect anything that has your attention.Â That's job one.Â And best practice is get it all, get it out of your head,Â and don't leave anything still lying aroundÂ in the dusty corners of your mind.

## Clarifying meaning

So we need to now clarify what it is that we had our attention on.

And what does clarify mean?

Well, in a way you could think of it as processing the stuff that you've captured.

Most people still have some thinking and decision making about stuff that's on their list. Very often I'll see things on a to-do list that look like mom, or bank, or doctor, or strategic plan. And that's great, you captured something there, but then there's still some decision making you need to apply.

I mean, what attention do you need to put on mom and her birthday? What attention do you still need to put on the bank and your credit line? So that's the executive decision making you need to make about what do these things really mean? And what specifically are you going to do about them, if anything? So there's some very simple, but very profound questions you need to ask about everything that you've captured or collected. If you pick up something out of your in-basket, something you had your attention on, the first question is, is it something that is actionable?

Is is something that you actually need to do something about?

**There are two optional answers to that question, yes and no. Maybe is a no.**

So are you going to do anything about mom's birthday?

Are you going to do something about the bank or the credit line?

If you say no, and by the way, there's a lot of things that we capture or collect or that are collected for us, for instance, in your email, that there is no action on.

There's a lot of those things. Yeah, I'm sure you take meeting notes. Those are captured ideas, but there's many things that are in those notes that you probably don't need to do something about.

And the no, if there is a no answer, you still have three options. **First is trash.** Now that I've seen it, I don't need it or I didn't need it to begin with.

By the way, a lot of people need to make that decision about a lot of things sitting in their email right now, as well as things sort of lying around.

As I say, trash self-generates, it does not self-destruct.

**Option two, if it's not actionable would be**, well, there's no action on this now, but there might be later. That's a category that we call incubate. Incubate means I need to let this hold for a while. I either need to think about it some more, or I need to let some time pass before I make a decision. So the bank, for instance, you might say, well, I don't really want to maybe research that yet because we're looking at other options for cash flow. But it is a good idea and maybe we should rethink that in two or three weeks.

And then the **third category, reference material.** I need to keep that. I need to be able to refer back to that.

So three non-actionable categories, trash, incubate, or reference. So when you say okay, there is an action, then there are two really key questions that bring real clarity to

what your work is.

And I use work in the very broad sense,

call it anything you want to get done that's not done yet.Â **And those two key questions, first of all, what's the very next action?** If it is an actionable thing, what's the very next thing that I need to do to move this forward?

So when I say next action, I'm talking about very granular, very specific visible, physical action. Not all the actions that you need to take, just the very next one, that interestingly we've discovered that that actually lets your mind relax when you at least know what the trigger action is, not necessarily all the succeeding ones that will come after that.

So set meeting is actually not a next action because it could be an email, a phone call, you could task your assistant to set the meeting.

**The second question you need to ask and answer is if that one action won't finish or complete whatever this is about, what's the project?**

So just using the common language of a project and creating a list of all of your projects, you actually can't do a project.

A project like give mom a birthday party, or handle the next holiday, or to launch the strategic plan, or to finalize the budget. You actually don't do those things. You do actions about those, **so a project is just an outcome that more than one action is required.**

The problem is if you don't actually then capture what's the project that's driving these things that have your attention, and you take one action and then you get distracted or you get pulled off to do something else,

now you don't have a place holder out here in the world, your mind takes it back.

Oh, I haven't finished yet, and it goes back inside your head. And that's what you don't want. So once more, clarify means, first of all, we've captured what's pulling on our attention, but then we need to put more specific attention on those things to discover exactly what they mean because to go to the next stage, which is to organize the results of that, clarifying what these mean and which category they go into is a primary step to begin with.
