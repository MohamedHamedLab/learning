# Deep Work
## Multitasking does not equal productivity

Sophie Leroy, a business professorÂ at the University of Minnesota,Â who conducted research on this phenomena in 2009,Â shows why.Â **She demonstrates that when switching from task "a"Â to task "b," our attention stays attachedÂ to the first activity. Which means we can only half focus on the second,Â which hurts our performance.**

ðŸ“– Â Her experiments utilized two groups.Â Group "A" worked on word puzzles until she interrupted themÂ to go on to reading resumes and makingÂ hypothetical hiring decisions.Â Group "B" got to finish their puzzlesÂ before moving onto the resumes.Â In between the two tasks, Leroy would give a quick testÂ to see how many key words from the puzzlesÂ were still stuck in the participants minds.Â The result,Â Group "A" was much more focused on the puzzle then thereforeÂ less focused on the important taskÂ of hiring the right person.

The long and the short of it,Â multitasking is no good for productivity.Â Neither is being electronically connected all the time.Â In fact, while it might seem harmless to keep social mediaÂ and email tabs open in your web browser,Â the mere fact of seeing things pop up on your screenÂ is enough to derail your focus.Â Even if you're not immediately addressing notifications.

<aside>
ðŸ“– Â For instance, the 2012 study by the consulting firmÂ McKinsey found that the average workerÂ spends over 60% of their work week using onlineÂ communication tools and surfing the internet with justÂ 30% devoted to reading and answering emails.

Despite this data, workers feel like they're workingÂ more than ever.Â That's because completing small tasks and moving informationÂ around makes us feel busy and accomplished.Â But it's actually just preventing us from truly focusing.

## Strategies for achieving deep work

While there's no universal strategy,Â here are a few you might find helpful.Â 

The first is the **monastic approach"Ø§Ù„Ø±Ù‡Ø¨Ù†Ø©"**.Â This strategy works by eliminatingÂ all sources of distraction and secludingÂ yourself like a monk.Â The second is called the **bimodal approach**,Â which involves setting a clearly definedÂ long period of seclusion for workÂ and leaving the rest of your time free for everything else.

The third is the **rhythmic approach**.Â The idea here is to form a habit ofÂ doing deep work for blocks of say,Â 90 minutes, then using a calendarÂ to track your accomplishments.Â 

And finally the **journalistic strategy** isÂ to take any unexpected free time in your daily routineÂ to do deep work.Â But regardless of which technique you employ,Â it's key to remember that they'reÂ methodical, not random.Â In fact, that's exactly the difference betweenÂ being in the zone and deep work.Â After all, you get in the zone by chanceÂ and often only after hours of procrastination.

On the other hand, deep work is intentionalÂ and desired, which makes it essential toÂ have rituals that prepare your mind for it.Â One ritual might be to define your space.Â 

It can be as simple as placing aÂ "Do not disturb" sign on your office door,Â or going to a library or coffee shop.Â The latter is especially helpfulÂ if you work in an open office.Â

ðŸ“– Just take J.K. Rowling who while finishingÂ her last Harry Potter book stayedÂ at a five star hotel just to escapeÂ her hectic home environmentÂ and cope with the pressure so she could get into deep work.

Another ritual is to define boundaries. 

For example,Â by disconnecting the Internet or turning off your phone.Â And finally, make your deep work sustainable,Â because whether it's light exercise, food, or aÂ caffeine pick me up, it's essential to give your bodyÂ what it needs if you want to focus.Â If you don't, you will never have the mentalÂ energy you need to stay in deep work.

## Productive meditation

Productive meditation can rewire your brainÂ and help you focus.Â Here's how it works.Â Use moments that would otherwise be unproductive,

Â like walking your dog

taking a shower or commuting to work

to consider a problem you need to take careÂ of without letting your mind change subjects.Â To get started ask yourself questionsÂ that identify different issues in solving a given problem.

Then, once you've landed a specific target,Â ask yourself action questions like,Â what do I need to accomplish my goal?Â Think about it like a hardcore workoutÂ routine for your brain,Â that will help build your focus.Â It's also key to be mindful of your intentionsÂ when using social media and the Internet.Â For instance, if you use FacebookÂ to keep in touch with friends,Â then use it to communicate with them,Â but also make an effort when possibleÂ to spend more time with them in person.Â And if you can't manage to do thatÂ try going cold turkey.

**Quit social media for 30 days**Â and afterward, ask yourself,Â would the past month would have beenÂ that much better with social media in my life?Â Did anyone care that I stopped using it?Â If you answer no to both,Â give it up for good.Â But if you answer yesÂ then it's probably for the best to return to it.

## Schedule work and free time

scheduling both workÂ and free time is essential to restoring energy.Â 

When you get home from work or running errands all dayÂ often all you want to do is well, nothing.Â And for lots of us that means,Â having no fixed time slots where we have to complete tasks.Â 

But ironically enough we end upÂ stuck to the same routine every night.Â We watch TV, scroll through our phones,Â or stare at our computers, then when it's finally timeÂ to go to bed, we feel more tired than when we got home.

Leaving us depleted of energy for the next day.Â 

How can you avoid that situation?

By scheduling everything you doÂ you'll free up time for being mindful of how you spend it.Â 

At the start of every workday,Â 

create a schedule that is dividedÂ into blocks of at least 30 minutes.

Â In this schedule you should set both work and personal tasksÂ like time to relax, eat, or catch up on email.Â 

It's inevitable that your schedule change during the day.Â But if this happens just rearrange your blocks.

The idea isn't to strictly abide by your itinerary,Â but to cultivate awareness about how you spend your time.Â That means it's also key to plan your evenings and weekendsÂ ahead so you can take actions toward specific goals.Â So try to leave your work at the office for instance.Â By imposing limitations and not checkingÂ on our email after a certain time.Â By doing so you'll give your mindÂ the space it needs to shut down.Â Finally, planning your evenings and weekendsÂ around activities other than those involving the internet,Â can help you revitalize your mind and body.

Maybe it's reading, exercise, or justÂ some quality time with loved ones.
