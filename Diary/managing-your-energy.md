# Managing Your Energy for Sustainable High Performance
 
## About energy management

 There are four reservoirs "خزانات" of energy that we need to tap, or we need to regularly fuel and refuel in order to live the richest and most satisfying, and productive lives. 

There's **physical energy**, which is the quantity of your energy.

And what we've discovered is that all four of these sources of energy are absolutely critical to being fully fueled, that none of them is sufficient by itself, and that all of them influence one another. 

There's **emotional energy**, which is the quality of your energy, how you feel. 

There's **mental energy**, which is the focus of your energy.

And there's what we call **spiritual energy**, which is the energy derived from purpose, from a sense that what you do really matters.

The Energy Project is about what it requires, what it takes to be more wholly human. There are two primary components of that.

The first is simply about **awareness**. What we're looking at is the interior landscape. What's going on inside you? And it turns out, this is a vast unexplored territory of infinite potential, and what we've tried to do is really provide a map for understanding what's going on inside you so that you're in a position to influence it. **You can't change what you don't notice.** 

And the second component is to really introduce you to **strategies** grounded in the science of high performance, the research that tells us what works and what doesn't with the science that tells us in a more data driven way what actually contributes to your being able to live the life that you're capable of living.

## Physical

the problem that we face in managing our own physical energy more skilfully and with more conscientiousness "بضمير اكثر" is that our lives are overwhelming and there is that burning platform that we all feel to get the next thing done. And we never get enough done. You can't fundamentally take care of the elements of your life, whether it's family or work, or your community,  if you're not effectively taking care of yourself.

There are four components of **physical energy** and they're very, very specific and concrete. 

T**here's sleep,** which is the foundation of physical energy, so if you don't get enough sleep it almost doesn't matter what else you do to increase your physical energy, 

and then there's **nutrition**, and **fitness**, the ability to transport oxygen through your body, 

and finally, the one that most of us don't pay much attention to after kindergarten or nursery school, is **rest**. Meaning, daytime renewal, the refuelling of your energy across a day.

Let's start with sleep. What we know about sleep is that 95% of all human beings require at least seven to eight hours of sleep in order wake up fully rested. 2.5% of the population require more than eight hours.

So, 97.5% of all human beings need at least seven hours of sleep minimum to feel fully rested. Well, think about your own life. What I've discovered and what many of the folks we work with have discovered is that if you get enough sleep, it will cover all kinds of other mistakes you make or failures you have in managing other aspects of your energy.

 Then, there's nutrition. Now, nutrition is a hornet's nest. And the truth is that when all is said and done, nobody really can say with certainty what the right foods and the wrong foods are to eat, with the one exception being sugar. We know that sugar doesn't serve you well. Sugar, from an energy perspective, is something that causes, as we all know from our experience, big jumps in energy and then deep crashes in energy. Beyond that, what we are looking for when we think about nutrition is what is it that leaves you feeling sustainably energised? 

Then there's fitness. Fitness can be defined as the speed of recovery. So, the fitter you are, the faster you recover. Which means that to be fit is to make recovery important. Interval training is an expression of that same notion, that intense effort and then quick recovery is training you to recover faster, and that's what fitness is all about. 

And finally, there's rest. So, rest is something that we haven't valued as a culture.

We don't value it in organizations, we don't value it in our lives, and we're forever willing to get up one hour earlier if we think it will allow us to get one more hour of work done, or to stay up one hour later. But the reality is that **our bodies are designed to work in waves of 90 minutes.** What we would say is that you ought to be, and this is called the **Ultradian Rhythm**, renewing or refueling yourself at least every 90 minutes.

You shouldn't work for more than 90 minutes continuously because you will suboptimal "دون المستوي الامثل" after that period. And the key to renewal is not how long you renew, but it's how well you renew. The power of renewal is not just that you feel more rested and relaxed after you do it, but it's also that when you're working, you're capable of really working. So there they are, those are the four sources of physical energy, nutrition, fitness, sleep, and rest. I've just shared with you very systematic ways that you can address the key elements of each of those four sources of energy and create a powerful foundation for yourself as you move onto managing the other three sources of energy that are critical to you.

## Emotional

Emotional energy refers very simply to **how you feel**. Because how you feel profoundly effects how you perform and how you show up in the world. We spent a lot of years working with professional competitions  and what we discovered was that when we asked them the question, how do you feel when you're performing at your best, they consistently gave us the same answers. They used adjectives like confident, excited, happy, calm, focused, in the zone.

Well, that was really good because now we know that the way you need to feel to perform at your best is **high positive energy**. And of course the problem is, there are many times during our days at work and in our lives where we're not feeling high positive energy. 

So when you're not feeling that way, how are you feeling and what are the consequences? Well, it turns out that there are **four different ways that people feel across the course of a day or a week and only one of them serves high performance optimal.**

So the most common move when you're not in the performance zone is into something we call the **survival zone.** So if this is high positive energy, **the survival zone is high negative energy.** We also can refer to this as fight or flight, because this is what happens when you feel you're under some sort of threat, there's a danger, there's something happening in the environment that makes you feel at risk. It might be some interaction you've had with your supervisor. It could be a conflict with a colleague.

It could be that you've suddenly had a deadline imposed on you that's going to force you to miss your weekend plans. There are dozens of ways in which we can be triggered and land in the survival zone. We never choose the survival zone, it's something we reactively end up in in order to deal with a threat. 

You're going to burn down that reservoir of energy very, very quickly and you're eventually going to land in this lower zone, **which we call the burnout zone.** And the burnout zone, not surprisingly, low energy, and what energy there is, is negative, is the worst place from which to perform. 

So what I've identified now are three different zones, the performance zone, where we know we want to be as often as possible when we're working to achieve a particular goal, and then two negative zones that people move into when the experience is one of threat.

So what's the solution to this problem in our incredibly demanding lives? Demanding physically, demanding emotionally, demanding mentally. The solution is unexpected. It's this lower right, we call it low positive, this lower right zone, or the renewal zone. And the big idea here is moving between intense periods of expenditure of energy in the performance zone and then intermittent periods of renewal in the lower right zone.

So if we're deliberately moving between the performance zone and the renewal zone, we're less likely to move reactively into the survival zone, because we're not depleting ourselves and because when a problem arises, our instinct is to refuel ourselves to take care of ourselves instead of to aggressively act to deal with that problem or to run from that problem. Most of us come to work assuming that we should check our emotions at the door and that when people ask us during the day, how are you doing or how're your feeling?, the answer ought to be, I'm good, I'm fine.

But the reality is that even when we're not aware of it, emotions are circulating through us all day long and we all know them, however well acquainted we are with them or not. And those emotions, if you have any doubt that you have emotions, just think about this question. Who are you at your best? What are the adjectives that describe who you are at your best and who are you at your worst? What are the adjectives that describe you at your worst? And you will find that you can write down, particularly at your worst, but you can write down a very good, long list of those pretty easily.

And that's going to tell you right there the difference between the emotions that serve you well and the emotions that serve you poorly.

## Mental

How do you actually train your brain to be more absorbed   as opposed to succumb to distraction? How do you train specifically tactical or narrow attention versus big-picture attention? The key to training attention is building into your day periods during which you are 100% absorbed, or at least making the effort to be 100% absorbed without distraction.

**And the key to that is designating a start time and a stop time.** The anxiety of thinking that you have to be fully absorbed indefinitely will overwhelm your ability to do that very quickly. So, one of the most important strategies that we have given to people, and it's one I've had in my own life as a ritual for over 15 years, is to do the most **important thing first in the morning for a designated period of time no longer than the 90 minutes that we're capable of paying attention in an absorbed way**.

That's our limit as a regular dose, and then taking a rest. There is enormous power in being able to gain control over your attention, and we've known this for thousands of years, and this is what meditation at its most basic level is all about. Particularly concentration meditation where the goal is simply to focus on one thing at a time. That's actually the definition of meditation, the ability to focus on one thing at a time.

So, one of the really good ways to train your attention is to build a little meditative practice, or to build an attention control practice if that makes your more comfortable. And one of the things we've discovered is success comes best from biting off just a little bit at the start, because the mind we know has a mind of its own. What we know from the research is that in 60 seconds it is possible to completely clear the blood stream of cortisol, which is the most insidious of the stress hormones that tends to get aroused over the course of a day.

This is the issue that people bring to us as the most problematic in their lives over, and over, and over again. Big picture attention is not just the ability to step back from what you're doing and look at it in a broader way, it's also introducing originality. When I'm thinking about a new problem, I just open a notebook and I let myself write freely.

And I don't try to order it, and I don't try to sensor it, and I will write as long as it takes to discover, to get to something new. But again, the critical element of training attention is that you take a task and you do it repetitively for a defined period of time, and you will get better at it.

## Spiritual

**We call the fourth dimension of energy spiritual energy, but we don't mean by that anything necessarily religious.** What we actually mean is the energy derived from a sense of purpose. The energy you get from the experience that what you do matters. The sense of meaning. Human beings are meaning makers. That's what separates us from animals across the spectrum who are incapable of self-reflection. We need to make meaning out of the events of our life, and all of us know that when we feel passionate, committed to what is we're doing that we bring much more energy to it.

So, one way to think about how to actually tap into spiritual energy is to imagine that there are three components of what makes life meaningful, of what adds meaning to life, of what generates a sense of purpose. And throughout history there are a number of great thinkers who've referred to these as **the good, the true, and the beautiful** as the three sources of meaning that people can derive.

So, **what is the good?** Well, that speaks almost for itself. The good is the sense of purpose you derive from adding value to other people and to the world. We all know the power of the experience, not only of feeling that you've been of service, that you have helped somebody or something, but also the experience of serving something larger than yourself, and a sense of connection that you don't get when what you're serving is only your self-interest.

**The true** is the pursuit of truth, it's the pursuit of understanding. The sense that we really understand something at a very fundamental level. Understanding something better by itself is a source of meaning, and it is particularly so when we can pass on that knowledge to others, because then that hooks up to the good. That's the interconnection between the good and the true.

**And then, there is the beautiful.** But when you talk about the beautiful, it's really about the pursuit of perfection, it's about the pursuit of, or if not the pursuit of, the appreciation of the pursuit of perfection. The beautiful shows up in nature, the beautiful shows up obviously among artists. One of the reasons that people can be so inspired by nature is that it connects them, in a sense, to the possible.

So, the good, the true, and the beautiful are all ways in which we can tap into a source of meaning that fits our particular inclination. An artist doesn't derive meaning in the same way a scientist does, and a scientist doesn't derive meaning in the same way that a classic scholar does. But when we are serving something larger than ourselves, when we are pursuing something that connects us, this is a source of energy that powerfully moves people.
