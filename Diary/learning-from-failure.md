# Learning from Failure
We normally love to celebrate success , and we  dislike failures, but that is not really good logic and it depends on how your define things

Failure is part of the process of learning that helps increase the chance of future success 

the fear of failure is the primary reason people fail to set personal goals and always set weak professional goals

- the fear of failure is created by socially to be, it start with our educational systems most of them train us to value good grade and fear bad grade, on top of this we live in a society that is based on competition (sports, scholarships, internships, jobs, promotions) that is why people avoid new jobs, career paths and trying new hobbies , they fear the learning curve and nit getting it right, they fear others questioning their competence , intelligence and the lack of acceptance
- our main mental mistake is to over focus on one failure instead of stepping back to see the big picture, it's real and it can be painful but it does not define you

You only have to remember one basic piece of logic. Failure is normal and necessary, when you accept and embed that idea into your daily thinking routine, that's when the negative idea of failure begins to fade while positive ideas about learning and improving become your focus.

## Types of Failures
### Personal errors

mistakes that happen because of a lack of ability , poor focus or bad fit between the team and the requirement of the work and this is the type of issue that gives failure bad name, should be avoided by interview process and talent management to make sure the right people doing are doing the right work

### Eexternal factors

these are thing out of control and all project face uncertainty, you can not just predict everything , you can only do two things to mitigate any pain associated from unexpected failures  

1. for any important work develop you plan then work on backup plans
2. occasional audit to ensure that your team and organization are using the best available technologies and the best-in-class methodologies 

### Striving effects

these are failures that occurred in the service of change, improvement and innovation , and that means trying something new that hasn't been done, and that is important for learning but sometime hurts, whether you are stretching your personal competencies or you are  pushing your limits and trying to increase your capacity

If you make the latter choice, you'll be wise over time to align yourself with innovative and learning-oriented teams, bosses and companies. In the end, the try, fail,
## Owning your mistakes
**why they have to own their mistakes?**

It's because owning your mistakes really does represent the first step in learning from a setback. It's about accepting that you're responsible for some or all of whatever negative outcome just occurred.

**why it's so common for people to not own up to their errors?**

There's really three reasons

- it's so easy to blame someone else. But the blame game is never productive.
- people conscious of the fact that they might be partially to blame don't want to be publicly associated with an error. So they don't speak up and own their contribution.
- we often resist owning our mistakes as a defensive mechanism in order to preserve our self-confidence and our belief in our own ability to do something successfully.

But in the long run, owning your mistakes can be very useful to your development as a professional.

You have to accept your fault. We all do. This does not mean you're accepting bad performance or low standards for yourself, It simply means that you understand we're all having we all having weaknesses and make mistakes, and that you wish to use this reality to push yourself, to motivate yourself, to strive harder.

**And process is very simple**

- Honestly seek to understand your contribution to the mistake.
- Admit it to the person or group who might be relevant.
- Offer an explanation if needed.
- Tell them what you've learned or what you intend to do to reduce the likelihood this mistake happens again.
- Then follow through and do what you said you'd do.

**And the benefits from that will make this process worth it.**

- you'll learn faster and more effectively. Cause you're being creating a situation rather than just responding to your errors and seeking to understand them, and fix them.
- you'll be prove to others that you have integrity and that you know how to step up and take responsibility for your actions. You'll also be revealing yourself to be more human and authentic, since you can admit your imperfections. In the eyes of others, that makes you a lot more relatable.
- All of these together suggest that you'll be building stronger relationships and earning respect because you're choosing to deal with the reality we all face, and you're doing it in a positive way.

To summarize, you have to be ready to smile, laugh, and learn the next time your fault become apparent. Because you know that for a smart person, they're just catalysts for learning.
