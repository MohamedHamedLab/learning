# Story Telling

- Start with a hook.
  A hook is basically an opening part of a talk where you can get your audience curious about your content. An effective hook is one that's relatable. It humanizes a technical problem.
  An effective hook is one that's relatable. It humanizes a technical problem. The audience can imagine themselves or someone they know tackling a similar problem. And it's memorable, so even if the audience forgets all the details and points you made, they won't forget the hook

- After you've hooked your audience, share an overview of your talk
  not an agenda, like you typically hear from presenters. Here's what I mean. Instead of listing the three things you're going to be talking about, you'd say something like, "In my talk today, "I'll share three best practices "we wish we had known that night."

- Build credibility with a story
  Share the problem you are facing first,and make sure it's a problem that your audience members may go through at some point in their careers.

üìù Even though I was the lead network security engineer, and I had studied all the best practices in graduate school, I wasn't prepared to handle my company's first distributed denial of service attack, a DDOS.

Another way to show your credibility is to share how you challenged your own expertise.

üìù My knowledge was outdated, because I'd gone to grad school before mobile phones and the Internet of Things. Because of that, I had to get outside support to fend off the attack. It took an entire week, so by the time we were done, we'd lost a third of our customers.In the midst of firefighting, I realised I needed to be more proactive about my company's security policies and practices, and keep my knowledge up-to-date

Give the audience the impact or the outcome of the solutions you'll be sharing with them, and demonstrate how they're widely applicable

üìù Over the past ten years of my career, I've used three approaches to help startups and Fortune 500 companies resist attacks, be resilient in the midst of one, and bounce back within hours or days

- Share a personal story
1. It's a great hook because a personal story is relatable. Audiences can imagine what was going on from your perspective, 
2.  it evokes empathy. Even if they haven't been through a similar experience they can start to empathise with what you went through.
3.  It also builds connections, people attend talks to hear about experiences, this is how they connect to you.

üìù All my friends were doing it. Building an iPhone app, so I thought how hard could it be? Having built a handful of software as a service, SAS applications I figured the transition would take me a couple of months. I'd focus on learning the language, building a small prototype and then I'd be ready to launch it. What I didn't realize at the time was that iPhone app development was much more involved! It took me nearly 18 months to launch my prototype. Today I'm going to share with you the 10 things I wish I had known when I started to build my first iPhone app.
