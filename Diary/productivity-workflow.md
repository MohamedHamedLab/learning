ideas and realistic suggestions to everyone seeking to simplify a hectic schedule.

 To channel your energy more efficiently so you can work more effectively throughout your day, use the six-step productivity workflow formula.

## The Six-step productivity workflow

### 1- Determine what to do.

Start by examining your to-do list : If it's filled with tasks with assorted due dates, it's probably long and overwhelming.

If you've thrown in some items you couldn't say no to doing, your list is  very long. Delegate"ÿ™ŸÅŸàŸäÿ∂" tasks that don't benefit you. Drop time-wasters from your day, such as 

- repeated email checks
- internet visits.

To decide what stays on your list

- estimate your personal return on investment.
- the value you offer your company.
- Demonstrate "ÿßÿ∏Ÿáÿ±" that you've earned or saved your company at least three times your base salary each year.
- If you can't determine a financial value, find a way to show how your company would suffer from your absence.

For example, list your 10 most important responsibilities and compare whether they match your boss's perception "ÿ™ÿµŸàÿ±" of your priorities and value. 

### 2- Schedule time to do your tasks and assign realistic deadlines.

- Do most of your work when you feel focused and energized.
- Exit meetings that run late or veer off-topic.
- Don't accept work that should go to someone else. Simply refuse such chores in a positive way. Say that you'd love to take on the assignment, but that you just can't do it right now. However, you'd be happy to consider it sometime in the future.
- Be gracious"ŸÑÿ∑ŸäŸÅ" but when you decline a request, never explain why.

Don't schedule unnecessary meetings. 

- Estimate the hourly salary of everyone who's coming to a meeting to see if its cost makes financial sense.

### 3- Focus your attention.

- Workers typically waste 28% of their day
- handling interruptions.
- Limit discussions with coworkers.
- Excuse yourself from office politics.
- Come to work on-time and take shorter lunch breaks.
- Don't multitask.
- You waste several seconds each time you move from one chore to another.
- Those seconds quickly add up to hours of lost time.
- To avoid procrastination, break big tasks down into smaller jobs and set deadlines for each one.
- J**ot down or voice-record your ideas so you don't waste time trying to remember them later.**

### 4- Process new information.

- Decrease the amount of data you receive each day.
- Delegate any item that does not help you advance toward your goals.
- unsubscribe from nonproductive mailing lists and stop unwanted messages from coming again.
- Don't keep paper or emails because you think you'll need them later. Only file important items that don't require immediate action.
- If you really need to put off a task, assign it a realistic due date. Otherwise, heed the start to finish rule. Scan the data, make any required decisions, and act.

### 5- Close the loop.

- Be on top of your tasks, focus on your goals, make your deadlines, and transmit information clearly.

üìñ STORY The president of an automotive parts manufacturing corporation once contacted his finance department to request a cost quote for a talk he planned to give. He wanted a ballpark value, a number that would take only a few minutes to compute. Unfortunately, the staff member misinterpreted the assignment and thought the president needed an accurate quote. He spent hours putting an estimate together. Their misunderstanding wasted time and money.

- When you speak to your team or to coworkers, be clear and concise.
- You can't increase your efficiency if a micromanager hangs around controlling you.
- Anticipate your boss's needs and provide information before he or she asks for it. Document everything and insist on receiving all directives in writing. These steps will help you defend yourself if a manager tries to blame you for any mishap.

### 6- Manage your capacity.

Your health comes first.

- If you don't take care of yourself, you won't have the capacity to work efficiently. When you over work, your productivity wanes.
- Set realistic expectations.
- Don't underestimate the regenerative power of sleep which resets your natural circadian rhythms on a daily basis. You'll perform at your best when you are rested.

- Also, take power naps of an hour or less to improve your performance.
- make sure to take a morning and an afternoon break.
- What's more, eat often and eat healthfully. You might feel lightheaded if you go longer than six hours without food. Skipping meals is unhealthy and can cause your blood sugar level to drop.
- When it's lunch time, leave the office. Don't eat at your desk.
- savor your big breaks, weekends, holidays and vacations. It isn't enough to sit in front of the television and think about your job. To adequately recharge your batteries, leave work behind and participate in something you love to do.
- be active. A 10-minute energetic walk revs up your engine and keeps your energy up for a couple of hours.
- To pack more physical activity into your day, park your car far from your destination and walk. Take a stroll at lunchtime or when you talk on the phone. Use the stairs instead of the elevator. Watch your favorite television program while you use a treadmill or a stationary bicycle. - [Teacher] Finally, to bring more joy to your life, make empowered choices. Eeyore, the mopey donkey in the "Winnie the Pooh" series, always saw the dark side of life. His glass was permanently half empty. On the other hand, Tigger, another "Winnie the Pooh" character, bounced around with zest for life. Be like Tigger. Stop thinking that bad things happen only to you. The choices you make can change the direction of your life. Hang around with folks who have positive attitudes. When you spend time with those you love, you recharge your energy level and when you act kindly toward others, your body circulates mood-lifting endorphins.
