> An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.
Benjamin Franklin
> 

Your knowledge and experience are your most important professional assets.

Your knowledge becomes out of date as new techniques, languages, and environments are developed.

Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar tomanaging a financial portfolio

1. Serious investors invest regularly‚Äîas a habit.
2. Diversification is the key to long-term success.
3. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and
high-risk, high-reward investments.
4. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.
5. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically.

To be successful in your career, you must manage your knowledge portfolio
using these same guidelines.

### Building Your Portfolio

Invest regularly : Just as in financial investing, you must invest in your knowledge portfolio regularly. Even if it‚Äôs just a small amount, the habit itself is as important as the sums. A few sample goals are listed in the next section.

Diversify : The more different things you know, the more valuable you are.

Manage risk: It‚Äôs not a good idea to invest all of your money in high-risk stocks that might collapse suddenly, nor should you invest all of it conservatively and miss out on possible opportunities. Don‚Äôt put all your technical eggs in one basket. Prepared exclusively

Buy low, sell high: Learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock, but the payoff can be just as rewarding. Learning Java when it first came out may have been risky, but it paid off handsomely for the early adopters who are now at the top of that field.

Review and rebalance. This is a very dynamic industry. That hot technology you started investigating last month might be stone cold by now. Maybe you need to brush up on that database technology that you haven‚Äôt used in a while. Or perhaps you could be better positioned for that new job opening if you tried out that other language

### Goals

**Learn at least one new language every year** : Different languages solve the same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking and avoid getting stuck in a rut

**Read a technical book each quarter**: Once you‚Äôre in the habit, read a book a month. After you‚Äôve mastered the technologies you‚Äôre currently using, branch out and study some
that don‚Äôt relate to your project.

**Read nontechnical books, too**: It is important to remember that computers are used by people‚Äîpeople whose needs you are trying to satisfy. Don‚Äôt forget the human side of the equation

**Take classes: Look for interesting courses at your local community college or university,**

**Experiment with different environments:**  If you‚Äôve worked only in Windows, play with Unix at home

**Stay current:** Subscribe to trade magazines and other journals Choose some that cover technology
different from that of your current project.

### Search for happiness

we‚Äôre all looking for happiness. Once we have our basic human needs like food and shelter taken care of, most of our goals are geared toward finding happiness. Sadly, our activities are often mismatched to that one overarching goal. This is because we as humans get bogged down in the means and forget about the end.I might be happier if I had more money. I might be happier if I got more and better recognition for my accomplishments. I might be happier if I were promoted in my company or I became famous. But what if I were poor and had a trivial job but I was really happy? Is that possible? If it were, should I be looking for more money? Or a better job? Maybe not. What‚Äôs certain is that,with the focused goal of happiness as a primary motivator, we can make better decisions about the smaller steps we take to achieve that goal. A higher salary might actually be desirable and lead toward happiness. But if you take your eyes off the primary goal, you can find yourself driving toward a higher salary at the expense of your happiness. It sounds ridiculous, but I‚Äôve done it. And so have you. Think about it.

<aside>
üìù Throughout this book, I‚Äôm going to give you advice that I hope will lead you to a happier and more rewarding career (and thereby to a happier life). You might make more money if you follow this advice. You might gain more recognition or even become famous. But please don‚Äôt forget that these are not the goals. They‚Äôre a means to an end.

### You are remarkabl

I was treading water and just letting one day eat the next. Before I knew it, six months were gone, and I didn‚Äôt have anything to show for it.

> I believe that everyone has remarkable in them, but You can‚Äôt be remarkable if you don‚Äôt love your environment, your tools, and your domain.
> 

> I hate the feeling that my presence doesn‚Äôt really matter and that the world would have been exactly no different in ameaningful way if my work hadn‚Äôt been done. To become remarkable, you have to believe that you‚Äôre making a significant dent in the universe.
> 

It‚Äôs not just about making better widgets and feeling secure in your job. It‚Äôs just as much about developing the skills and sensibilities for leading a more rewarding life filled with many remarkable aspects, with work just being one of them.

- Most people spend far more of their waking adulthood working than doing anything else
- According to research we spend half of our waking time at work.
- If your life is primarily consumed by your work, then loving yourwork is one of themost important keys to loving your life.
- Challenging,motivating, rewarding work is more likely to make you want to get up in the morning than dull, average tasks. Doing your job well means that the activity you do for 50 percent of your available time is something you‚Äôre good at.
- if you don‚Äôt do your job well, a large amount of your time will be spent feeling inadequate or guilty over not performing at your best.
- To me, leading a remarkable career is the best way I know to kick start that same desire for leading a remarkable life‚Äîone where you don‚Äôt just become a better and more valuable worker, but you become a better human too.

### You Own It

Most people follow everyone else‚Äôs plan but their own. To start differentiating yourself, all you have to do is stop and take a good look at your career. You need to be following your plan for you‚Äînot theirs

How do you come up with this plan?

Software is a business. As software developers,we are businesspeople. Our companies don‚Äôt employ us because they love us. They never have, and they never will. That‚Äôs not the job of a business. Businesses don‚Äôt exist so we can have a place to go every day. The purpose of a business is to make money.

you‚Äôre going to have to understand how you fit into the business‚Äôs plan to make money.

keeping you employed costs your company a significant amount of money. Your company is investing in you. Your challenge is to become an obviously good investment. You will start to judge your own performance in terms of the business value you bring to the organization or customer who is employing you.

- Think of your career as if it is the life cycle of a product that you arecreating. That product is made up of you and your skills, we‚Äôll look at four facets that a business must focus on when designing, manufacturing, and selling a product. And we‚Äôll see how these four
facets can be applied to our careers:
1. **Choose your market:** Pick the technologies and the business domains you focus on consciously and deliberately. How do you balance risk and reward?How do supply and demand factor into the decision?
2. **Invest in your product**: Your knowledge and skills are the cornerstone of your product. Properly investing in them is a critical part ofmaking yourself marketable.
3. **Execute**: Simply having employeeswith a strong set of skills does not pay off for a company. The employees have to deliver. How do you keep up the delivery pace without driving yourself into the dirt? How do you know you‚Äôre delivering the right value for
the company?
4. **Market**: The best product in history will not actually get purchased if nobody knows it exists. How do you get find recognition in both your company and the industry as a whole without
‚Äúsucking up‚Äù?

### Be the Worst

Find a ‚Äúbe the worst‚Äù situation for yourself. You may not have the luxury of immediately switching teams or companies just because you want to work with better people. Instead, find a volunteer project on which you can work with other developers who will make you better via osmosis. Check for developer group meetings in your city, and attend thosemeetings. Developers are often looking for spare-time projects on which to practice new techniques and hone their skills.

### Invest in Your Intelligence

Learn a new programming language. But, don‚Äôt go from Java to C# or from C to C++. Learn a new language that makes you think in a new way. If you‚Äôre a Java or C# programmer, try learning a language like Smalltalk or Ruby that doesn‚Äôt employ strong, static typing. Or, if you‚Äôve been doing object-oriented programming for a long time, try a functional language like Haskell or Scheme. You don‚Äôt have to become an expert. Work through enough code that you truly feel the difference in the new programming environment. If it doesn‚Äôt feel strange enough, either you‚Äôve picked the wrong language or you‚Äôre applying your old way of thinking to the new language. Go out of your way to learn the idioms of the new language. Ask old-timers to review your code and make suggestions that would make it more idiomatically correct.

### Be a Specialist

### Avoid Waterfall Career Planning

The important thing to realize is that change is not only possible in your career but necessary. As a software developer, you would never want to pour yourself into developing something your client doesn‚Äôt want. Agile methodologies help prevent you from doing so. The same is true of your career. Set big goals, butmake constant corrections along the way. Learn from the experience, and change the goals as you go. Ultimately, a happy customer is what we all want (especially when, as we plan our careers, we are our own customers)‚Äînot a completed
requirement.

### Path with No Destination

the next time you have to wash the dishes, don‚Äôt wash them to get them done. Try to enjoy the experience of washing the dishes. Don‚Äôt focus on finishing them. Focus on the act of washing them itself. Doing the dishes is a mundane task that almost nobody savors. Software developers have a lot of similar drudgery to get through in the average day, such as time tracking and expense reporting, for example. The next time you have to do a task like this,
see whether you can find a way to focus on the task as you do it instead of anxiously rushing to finish it.

### Better Than Yesterday

Make a list of the difficult or complex improvements you‚Äôd like to make; they can be personal or professional. It‚Äôs OK if you have a fairly long list. Now, for each item in the list, think about what you could do today to make yourself or that item better than yesterday. Tomorrow, look at the list again. Was yesterday better than the day before? How can you make today better? Do it again the next day. Put it on your calendar. Spend two minutes thinking about this each morning.

### Make Yourself a Map

Before mapping out where you want to go, it can be encouraging and informative to map out where you‚Äôve been. Take some time to explicitly lay out the timeline of your career. Show where you started and what your skills and jobs were at each step. Notice where you made incremental improvements and where you seemed tomake big leaps. Notice the average length of time it took to make a major advancement. Use this map as input as you look forward in your career. You can set more realistic goals for yourself if you have a clear image of your historical progress. Once you‚Äôve created this historical map, keep it updated. It‚Äôs a great way to reflect on your progress as you move toward your newly defined goals.

### Go Independent

a big company makes a wonderful place to go and semiretire for a while if you‚Äôre burned out. But if you‚Äôre striving to be remarkable (which you are!), a big company is a hard place to get into the right groove in the same way that a bakery is a bad place to go to try to work off your love handles. The solution? Go independent

You have a set of skills. You‚Äôve honed them. You know what you‚Äôre worth. Becoming an independent contractor is one of the ultimate tests.You have no bureaucracy to hide behind. You are directly accountable to the people paying the bills. The idea that you are providing a service becomes directly apparent in everything you do. There is no team to share the blame when you do things wrong. It‚Äôs only you, your expertise, and your ability to execute.

Becoming an independent contractor also forces you to learn how to market yourself and at the same time tests your choices in domain and technology to focus on. You can‚Äôt rely on customers to find you when you go independent in the way that work will find you at a big company. You have to go out and find the customers. And once you‚Äôve found them, you have to convince them that you‚Äôre worth paying.

Apart from companies in the technology sector, the number of businesses relying on computer code is increasing drastically. It‚Äôs really no wonder it‚Äôs listed 7th of the top 20 jobs this year according to and Front-end engineer is number 1

- It is the science of structured thinking
- The pleasure of making things that are useful to other people, seeing code you wrote deployed in a live system and used by actual people, especially if it improves their lives in some way.

Computer programming is nothing more than problem solving. Every program
is designed to solve a specific problem.

Identifying the problem
Before you even touch a computer, identify the specific problem you want
the computer to solve.

### Good programmer

a ‚Äúgood programmer‚Äù should do everything in his power to make what he writes
as simple as possible to other programmers. A good programmer creates things that are
easy to understand, so that it‚Äôs really easy to shake out all the bugs.

programming divided into a lot of deferent sub careers
