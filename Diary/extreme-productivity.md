The more productive you are, the faster you can finish your work. That means more time to do the things that matter to you, and as a consequence, you will be more happy and refreshed, which will make you even more productive. how can we enter this positive cycle? It's really all about simplicity. Productivity is about developing a certain zen sense of busyness, expending minimal effort for maximum results.

## Prioritize your tasks and time

Prioritize your tasks and invest your time accordingly.Â Planning ahead, whether it's for next year,Â next month, or even next week can beÂ a daunting task when you're drowning in work,Â but looking down the line will pay offÂ big time in the long run.Â To get yourself thinking more long term,Â begin organising your work.Â 

Split up tasks into aims, objectives, and targets,Â so that you can begin to prfioritize.Â A good strategy is to divide tasksÂ according to how long they take to accomplish.

> For instance, career aims take five years or more.Â These are things like expanding your business network,Â or landing an executive level promotion.
> 

Objectives take between three and 24 months.Â For example, if you work for a shoe company,Â an objective might be to rebrand a sneaker line.Â 

targets are anything thatÂ will take three months or less, such as writingÂ progress reports or finishing part of a major project.Â 

Objectives and targets are both essential.Â After all, if you don't focus on theseÂ baseline endeavors "Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³Ø§Ø¹ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø§Ø³Ø§Ø³ÙŠØ©", you'll never reachÂ your larger career goals.

But it's also important to prioritizeÂ aims, objectives, and targets thatÂ both you and your employer are on board with.Â You should first focus on the things thatÂ both you and your boss want to achieve.Â Once that's done, you can addressÂ the tasks that concern only you.Â 

For example, say you want to meetÂ more people in your industry, and alsoÂ want to rebrand your firms sneaker line to boost profits.Â Since your employer also wants the second thing to happen,Â you would do best to focus on the rebranding first.

Then, once you parsed out your tasks,Â it's time to set some top priorities,Â that is the projects on whichÂ you'll spend the majority of your time.Â 

To ensure you're doing this effectively,Â you should track your work days,Â monitoring how you allocate your time.Â You might discover that you spend lots of timeÂ on activities that don't have much to doÂ with your objectives or targets.Â Maybe you're going to too many internal meetingsÂ and failing to prioritize the important ones.Â How you allocate your time is crucial to your productivity.Â Which leads us to another issue, procrastination "Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù…Ø§Ø·Ù„Ø©".

## Fight procrastination with deadlines

Fight procrastination with mini deadlinesÂ that hold you accountable.Â Have you ever found yourself with tons of work to doÂ and no idea where to start?

Â Situations like this can be paralyzing,Â so it's essential to know how to deal with them.Â 

One approach is to break your projects downÂ into smaller targets for which you can set mini deadlines.Â this a approach will let you to set smaller deadlinesÂ that split up tasks into more manageable chunks.

That way you can finish your work step-by-stepÂ well ahead of its due date.Â When using this approach,Â you should set your deadlines at similar intervalsÂ and avoid having them all pile up at the end.Â 

## Keep your perfectionism high

 each day you'll be faced with different requests from your colleagues, your boss, and your family. 

As these tasks come in, it's important to decide as quickly as possible whether or not you're going to handle them. If you are, it's then up to you to do so hastily. 

A good approach here is to apply the **OHIO principle**, also known as Only Handle It Once. For example, say you receive an email inviting you to a conference. You quickly browse the email then set it aside. Three days later, you remember the message but don't remember the name of the sender. As a result, you spend countless minutes scrolling back through your inbox. From there, you've got to read it again, wasting yet more time. On the other hand if you are using the OHIO principle, you'd check if the date was free and the topic interesting and make a decision right away so you don't have to come back to this email again. 

Another way to move forward with your work is to fight the temptation to be perfect when it comes to your low priority tasks. Remember that not everything needs to be done in a perfect way. You should reserve this privilege for your top level work since this is what your boss will see and judge. Nobody's going to be pleased if you spend loads of time answering meaningless emails so handle such tasks accordingly, get through them quickly, and move onto the important stuff.

## Write with efficiency

To improve the efficiency and quality of your writing,Â you need to add structure to the process.

You can do this by brainstorming,Â categorizing, and then outlining.

Â In the brainstorm phase,Â write down whatever thoughts come to mindÂ about the subject.Â Don't worry about order and structure.Â Paint the broadest strokes possible.Â 

From there comes the categorizing phaseÂ during which you add some order to your ideas.Â Group your ideas into categoriesÂ and then into subcategories.Â 

Once you've done that,Â you're ready to outline your pieceÂ by arranging your categories in a logical sequence.

then all you've got to do is write them outÂ adding an introduction and conclusion.Â 

But efficient writing isn't just about structure.Â It also requires time and quiet.Â After all, how are you supposed to focusÂ with your phone ringing, emails constantly flyingÂ into your inbox and colleagues pestering you?Â 

Try going to the office earlyÂ when nobody is around or staying a bit laterÂ after your coworkers have leftÂ or if your job involves traveling by train or plane,Â take this excellent opportunity to do some focused writing.

## Product over time invested

the product you deliver matters more than the time you spend on it. Do you judge the quality of a book on how long it took the author to write it? Of course not, and the same is true of work. Results are what count. The number of hours spent on any given project is irrelevant. 

For instance, say you write two reports 

The first one, on which you spent eight hours,Â turns out bad because you started it lateÂ and were anxious while writing it.Â 

The second, which took you only three hours to write,Â is excellent because you prepared for itÂ and knew just what to write.Â Which one do you think your boss will prefer?

it's totally irrational to value the numberÂ of hours you spend on something over the qualityÂ of the result.Â That being said, while working faster doesn't meanÂ you always leave the office early,Â it does mean you should feel free to take some time off.

It makes no sense to embrace a cultureÂ that favors long hours over productivity.Â Unfortunately, lots of managers still put more emphasis"ØªØ´Ø¯ÙŠØ¯"Â on hours worked than on results produced.Â They tend, often subconsciously"Ù„Ø§Ø´Ø¹ÙˆØ±ÙŠØ§",Â to value workers who put in overtime and weekend hours.Â 

As a result, many managers claim to favor resultsÂ but in practice favor employees who work long hours.Â Given what you now know about productivity,Â this is obviously a problem, however,Â it's one that you can changeÂ by preventing such a culture from taking root.

To do so, simply avoid making remarksÂ that reinforce the importance of working long hours.Â For instance, if a colleague leaves early,Â don't say things like, hey, banking hours?Â And if a coworker comes in late,Â avoid comments like, look who finally decided to show up.Â By avoiding such snide remarks,Â you'll be improving your workplace culture.Â Of course, there are other benefitsÂ to cutting back on long hours.Â For one, it gives you more time for your private life,Â whether that means an outing with your familyÂ or getting some exercise.

## Prioritize your private life

Prioritize your private lifeÂ and find a flexible place to work.Â 

Most people just work and work and workÂ thinking that's the most productive approach,Â but productivity is about much more than work.Â 

It's also closely connected to your personal lifeÂ and general lifestyle.Â After all, the point of being efficient at workÂ is to make time for your life outside of work.Â It's important to prioritize non-work related activitiesÂ and to stick to the standards you set.

This is essential for protectingÂ your personal and family time.Â 

For instance, you could make a ruleÂ that you'll always be home by a certain hour.Â If something urgent comes upÂ that absolutely can't be postponed,Â make a plan with your boss to finish it from homeÂ or come in early to finish it up.Â 

Remember, making sure you have timeÂ to spend with your family is essential,Â whether that means cooking together,Â sharing a conversation over dinner,Â or if you have kids, reading them a bedtime story.Â However you do it, it's key to make sureÂ that you're there for the ones you love.

But to make such a goal a reality,Â you need to show your boss that you're reliable.Â Build trust with her and she'll allow you to go home earlierÂ or make up time another day.Â If possible, learn to say no to late meetings.Â Simply postpone them, making a strong pointÂ that you need to go have dinner with your family.Â And in the best case scenario,Â just take a job at a company with flexible working hours.Â A 2008 survey found that flexible hoursÂ are the single most important determining factorÂ for employees when considering a job offer,Â which, as these blinks hopefully made clear,Â makes perfect sense.

For instance, imagine your partner suddenly falls ill,Â or that your kid is in a play that starts at 5:00 p.m.Â You wouldn't want to be stuck at workÂ during such important times,Â and, the truth is, you don't have to be.
