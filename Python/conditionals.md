# Conditionals 

## Example file for working with functions## define a basic function
```python
x, y = 100, 100
```
  
## Conditional flow uses if, elif, else  
```python
  if(x < y):
        st= "x is less than y"
  elif(x == y):
        st= "x is same as y"
  else:
        st= "x is grater than y"
  
  print(st)
```
## Conditional statements let you use "a if C else b"
```python

  st = "x is less than y " if(x<y) else "x is greater than or same as y"
  print(st)
  ```
