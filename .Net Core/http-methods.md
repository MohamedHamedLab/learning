# HTTP Methods
**GET** just retrieves the resource that you specify.

**HEAD** request behaves exactly the same as the GET request, but it only returns the HTTP headers and doesn't return the resource itself. HEAD is useful when you need to look at headers like Expires to control caching of resources.

**POST** specifically used to create resources or trigger other actions that change application state, it should be used to create resources when the resource ID is not known in advanced.

**PUT** method can also be used to create or update resources.PUT method. Like POST, the PUT method can be used to create or update a resource. with PUT can only be done if the full resource URI is known in advance. Since the URI is known by the client, instead of being generated by the server, as in the previous example with POST, retrying a failed request would just perform a full update on the same resource, rather than creating a new resource.

**DELETE** method looks simple by comparison. It simply deletes a resource with a known ID. Since it could be retried without any side effects, **DELETE** is an idempotent method

**PATCH** can be used for partial updates because it is not an idempotent method. You might be wondering why a partial update cannot be an idempotent operation.

**Should your API use POST or PUT?** To answer that question we have to define what it means for a method to be idempotent. An idempotent method is a method that has the same effect when sent once or multiple times. In other words, it doesn't have any side effects  For example, if I send a GET request once or 10 times, it has the same effect of reading the resource. The HTTP spec requires that GET request always be idempotent. **POST requests**, on the other hand, are not guaranteed to be idempotent. If I send a POST request to create a user and then send that request nine more times, I had the effect of changing the application state not one, but possibly 10 times, I probably created 10 new users.

**Only POST contains a response body**
